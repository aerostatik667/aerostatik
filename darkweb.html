        <h1>How to Enter Darkweb</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>First of all you should understand that this place could be dangerous if you would share your personal data and information.Don't buy anything or share your bank account data because it'ss likely to be stolen after that.</p>
	<p>If you still want to enter,download Tor browser because other browsers such as google chrome or microsoft edge are blocking darkweb sites so tor is essential for darkweb download it throught this link:https://www.torproject.org/download/  <p>
	<p>After you downloaded it i highly recommend you to use VPN for extra security but there is still 3 staged default VPN in tor browser. <p>
	<p>And then you should have search engine because normal search engines such as google are unabled to open these types of links.
For exaple, use onionland search engine:https://onionlandsearchengine.net/ and don't even think about using normal browsers to enter there because your browser shares your information with sites that you enter.So your data could be in robbers' hands and that not good a all.<p>
 	<p>Well now you can do whatever you want.Actually in darknet you can find any information you want which is not accessable in normal internet.
